Just interested in some desktop applications using javafx and using netty socket io java and clint socketIo java to setup a server, then used mysql to for the database
to add user login and account creation.
just use the server launcher to launch the server and then launch MainApp to launch clients. 
there is also ssl which will require your keystore password and keystore path.
